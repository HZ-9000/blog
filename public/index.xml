      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always loved reading through blogs about different adventures into niche and cool software projects.&#xA;Some of the coolest have been on compute clusters, writing programming languages from scratch, writing game engines from scratch,&#xA;and building home labs from the strangest pieces of hardware. However, I have always viewed these blogs as entertainment and a fun&#xA;way to share cool things, and not as a system for managing and recording knowledge. With this revelation I also want to create a&#xA;space to store thoughts akin to a library, having the goal of creating a medium for organized thought. This could end&#xA;up being completely disjointed and a collection of random gibberish who&amp;rsquo;s only interpreter is the one who wrote the gibberish to start.&#xA;But with any luck I will have learned to write and communicate in a way that is beneficial to not only me but to any wandering souls&#xA;who find this island in the vast sea of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
