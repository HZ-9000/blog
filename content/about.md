I have always loved reading through blogs about different adventures into niche and cool software projects.
Some of the coolest have been on compute clusters, writing programming languages from scratch, writing game engines from scratch,
and building home labs from the strangest pieces of hardware. However, I have always viewed these blogs as entertainment and a fun
way to share cool things, and not as a system for managing and recording knowledge. With this revelation I also want to create a
space to store thoughts akin to a library, having the goal of creating a medium for organized thought. This could end
up being completely disjointed and a collection of random gibberish who's only interpreter is the one who wrote the gibberish to start.
But with any luck I will have learned to write and communicate in a way that is beneficial to not only me but to any wandering souls
who find this island in the vast sea of the internet.
