I have always loved reading through blogs about different adventures into niche and cool software projects.
Some of the coolest have been on compute clusters, writing programming languages from scratch, writing game engines from scratch,
and building homelabs from the trangest pieces of hardware. However, I have always viewed these blogs as entertainment and a fun
way to share cool things, and not as a system for managing and recording knowledge.
